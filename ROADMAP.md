## Technical Considerations

### API Requirements
Features will leverage the [Miniflux Python client](https://github.com/miniflux/python-client):
- `get_categories()` - Category list
- `create_category()` - New categories
- `update_category()` - Edit categories
- `delete_category()` - Remove categories
- `refresh_all_feeds()` - Refresh all feeds
- `refresh_feed()` - Refresh single feed
- `create_feed()` - Add new feed
- `discover_feed()` - Auto-discover feeds
- `update_feed()` - Modify feed settings
- `get_feed_history()` - Last read entries
- `get_user()` - User settings
- `get_server_info()` - Server version

### API-Dependent Features (When Available)
These features are planned pending upstream Miniflux API support:

- **Disable HTTP/2 to avoid fingerprinting** - Not yet available in Miniflux API
  - Will be added to Feed Settings when the Miniflux server provides this option
  - UI component already prepared for future implementation

- **Entry Filtering Rules** - Internal support exists in Miniflux, not yet exposed via API
  - Entry Blocking Rules - Filter entries by date, title, URL, content, author, tags
  - Entry Allow Rules - Keep only entries matching specified criteria
  - Would support regex patterns for flexible filtering
  - Requires Miniflux API enhancement to expose feed-level entry filter configuration

- **URL Rewrite Rules** - Not yet available in Miniflux API
  - Separate from Content Rewrite Rules for manipulating entry URLs
  - Requires Miniflux API enhancement

### Data Model Updates
- Add `Category` model
